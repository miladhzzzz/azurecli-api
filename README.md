# azurecli-api FASTAPI
**Azure CLI wrapped in HTTP REST API**
<br>
dead simple HTTP-REST-API written in python using FASTAPI to execute commands on azure cli without leaving the browser.
<br>
swagger at "http://your-ip-address:5000/docs"
<br>
get endpoint is "http://your-ip-address:5000/api/v1/azure/{command}"
<br>
have fun!
